1. CORE CONCEPTS
-----------------
- Command Architecture: Framework for decision authority, structure, and flow in operations.
- C2 (Command & Control): Exercise of authority over assigned forces to accomplish a mission.
- C3 (Command, Control, Communications): Expanded focus including communication systems.
- C4ISR: Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance.

2. ARCHITECTURAL FRAMEWORKS
----------------------------
- DoDAF (Department of Defense Architecture Framework)
  - AV-1: Overview and Summary
  - OV-1 to OV-6: Operational Views
  - SV-1 to SV-10: System Views
  - DIV-1 to DIV-3: Data and Information Views

- NATO C3 Taxonomy
  - COP (Common Operational Picture)
  - ICC (Interoperable Command Capability)
  - LOCE (Levels of Command Engagement)

- ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010
  - Architecture Description (AD)
  - Stakeholders, Concerns, Views, Viewpoints

3. COMMAND LEVELS
------------------
- Strategic: Policy, direction (e.g., National Command Authority)
- Operational: Campaign planning and major operations
- Tactical: Execution of missions and tasks

4. KEY ELEMENTS
---------------
- Decision Rights: Who decides what and when
- Span of Control: Scope of responsibility
- Delegation: Levels of decision autonomy
- Synchronization: Timely and coherent action
- Situational Awareness: Real-time understanding of the operational picture

5. GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES
-------------------------
- Centralized: Strong control, slower reaction
- Decentralized: Fast reaction, needs trust and competence
- Federated: Balance between central coordination and local autonomy

6. DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS
----------------------------
- Role-based dashboards
- Rule-based engines
- AI/ML predictive analytics
- Kill chain automation (Find-Fix-Track-Target-Engage-Assess)

7. INTEROPERABILITY PRINCIPLES
-------------------------------
- Technical: Protocols, APIs, data formats
- Semantic: Shared meanings (ontologies, data dictionaries)
- Organizational: Agreements, SOPs, ROEs
- Procedural: Common workflows and TTPs

8. COMMON TOOLS & LANGUAGES
----------------------------
- SysML / UML: System modeling
- BPMN: Process modeling
- ArchiMate: Enterprise architecture
- STANAGs: NATO standard agreements

9. CONOPS STRUCTURE (ABBREVIATED)
---------------------------------
- Mission Statement
- Concept of Employment
- Roles and Responsibilities
- Information Flows
- Interoperability Requirements
- Timeline / Phases
- Risks and Mitigations

10. METRICS & KPIs
-------------------
- Decision latency
- Situational awareness accuracy
- Command agility
- Synchronization effectiveness
- Mission completion rate
